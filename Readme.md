## Competitive audits

| Contest    |Platform| Category                  | Ranking üèÜ   | Findings üîé| Comment |
|------------|---------|------------------|-----------|---------|----------|
| [Blast](https://cantina.xyz/competitions/c90131b4-5c7c-4ebc-a1f3-8002d219bfe0)| Cantina | L2, Bridge | TBA | TBA | Blast held the biggest contest in history with 1.2M reward pot. Although audited previously by Spearbit I managed to find some vulnerabilites which I'm proud of. Eagerly waiting for results.
| [Arcade](https://cantina.xyz/competitions/c2e31b04-fbb2-4355-80ef-141d58b6e0cc)| Cantina | NFT lending | TBA | TBA | Very solid codebase previously audited by a top-tier firm. Some good findings of mine were downgraded to low which were non-payable for this contest, unfortunately.
| [Allo V2](https://audits.sherlock.xyz/contests/109) | Sherlock | Capital management         | **#10**/397  | [5M](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin-judging/issues?q=is%3Aissue+honeymewn+is%3Aclosed)        | Found lots of vulns once I wrapped my head around the codebase. I wish I started a bit earlier.
| [Sparkn](https://www.codehawks.com/contests/cllcnja1h0001lc08z7w0orxx) | Codehawks   | Escrow | **#5**/100       | [1H, 1M, 4L](./reports/codehawks/sparkn.md)    | Small and solid codebase but still has some bugs in it.
| [BeedleFi](https://www.codehawks.com/contests/clkbo1fa20009jr08nyyf9wbx) | Codehawks   | Oracle-free perp lending | **#100**/300+       | [4H, 2M, 1L](./reports/codehawks/beedlefi.md)    | Very first security contest. Result was not great but I learnt some well-known vulnerabilites.
